Web client for ToastBoard - the Breader Breadboard.

To install:

1. Install node.js.
1. Go into index.js and change the IP address on line 16 to the IP address of your device.
1. Start the server by navigating to the main directory and entering `node index.js`
1. Point your browser to localhost:3000 (I've been using Chrome, haven't tested other browsers).
